                    <br>
                    <p class="display-6"> The Food For All program is an initiative that aims to tackle a global problem: hunger.  Across the  world almost 9% of the population goes hungry which equates to roughly 690 million people per day.  Numerous factors such as economic position or location are attributed to this alarming statisic.  Thankfully, due to the generous and life-saving services provided by food banks, people are able to get quality meals on their tables.  However, many of the needy cannot attain these foods due to them not knowing where their nearest foodbank is.  For the purposes of our project, we decided to use a UK-based API to help residents of the United Kingdom locate food.              
                    </p>
                    
                    <p class="display-6"> The program itself is based on Java and uses the <a href="https://github.com/givefood/data">Give Food API</a> to attain information.  Currently, we are in the process of making our product more user-friendly (creation of an app), however it is still fully operational.  We believe that our product can immensely help individuals as it provides them with quick, accurate, and realtime results.

               <p class="display-6"> The FFA food locator (link above) is a Java-based application that allows people to look for foodbanks in the United Kingdom.  The program entails concepts that we learned in AP Computer Science Applications such as Java and the Sinbad library.  The Sinbad library was introduced to our group quite recently and we really enjoy its simplicity in extracting data from datasets.  As a result, we wanted to incorporate elements of this dataset into our project and build something that would solve a problem.  Though the product currently is strictly limited to the United Kingdom, it just shows how useful our product can be when give more references.  Currently, our product is fully operational but we plan on making it more user-friendly (through the creation of an app).  To the right you can see our product demonstration and you can download it <a href= "google.com">here</a>
